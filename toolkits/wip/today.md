    - `pip`, `conda`, `apt`, or `brew`
    - `bash` or `cygwin`
    - Python and `git`
    - [Sublime](install-sublime.md) or `PyCharm`
1. Problem and solution types
2. Project: revisit crime data and classify or regress
3. Bots (Agents)
4. Project: set up and build your bot


## Books in the "Library"

  - Seife <small>(*say-fuh*)</small>: Decoding the Universe
  - Grus: Data Science from Scratch
  - Jurafsky: Speech and Language Processing
  - Norvig: AIMA
  - Mitchell: Complexity
  - Machine Learning with Python

## "Deep Thoughts" (not by Jack H)

**THE** fundamental law of the universe according to a growing number of physicists:

> "Information is neither created nor destroyed."

Seife explains it this way. Our genes and cells are "information pumps" fighting against the homogenization of information across the universe. Like heat pumps (air conditioners) fighting to keep things at different temperatures. Or like Maxwell's Demon trying to push all the "red" atoms to one side of the wall (only it does require energy because it requires information about each atom).

A corollary that became a slogan for Pirate Bay, among others.

> ["Information wants to be free"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free)

And a "rebel" product that came out of that collective thought experiment and information theory research was a monetary instrument built only of information (so it can only be created by spending a lot of energy on the "printing press", which costs more money than face value of the currency).

##  Review/Quiz

The information is still in there somewhere... I promise. You just have to spend the energy to collect it all back up.

- Give me a keyboard shortcut.
- How can I get help about a function or method or class or object in ipython
  - Can I get the source code?
- How can quickly find the expression I typed an hour ago?
  - BONUS: in ipython, how can I turn everything I wrote for the past session into a script?
  - DOUBLE BONUS: the session before this one?
- How do you copy a repository to your computer for the first time?
- What is a Regression?
  - Bonus: where does the word come from

Stuff I never told you about

- How do you launch a `python` console
- How do you run a `python` script
- What is a good "SHABANG" for a `python` script 

If you can launch python you can finish the course. `ipython` is just "syntactic sugar" and CLI goodness. And `ipython notebook` or `Jupyter` is really only for presentation/sharing.
