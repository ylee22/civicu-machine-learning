# Git

You're about to learn about the coolest development tool on the planet

GitHub is not `git`. GitHub is one of many web interfaces to `git`. It may be the most efficient, open, generous, and socially responsible, sustainable company I know of. But it is a corporation, a website, not a tool.

`git` came out of the mind of Linus Torvalds in a dispute with bitbucket (Atlassian, Jira, Confluence, etc) over their version control tool called `mercurial` or `hg` on linux. Plus atlassian wanted to charge him to run his Linux development projects on it. So he did what Linus does and built his own VCS from scratch. Linus, and most developers, value tool development above all else.

There are a ton of resources out there with better diagrams than I could draw.

> git tutorial getting started


He knows how to build a powerful tool that can "scale" reliably.

So the best place to start is [his essential docs](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)

But if you want a more "layman's" introduction, [this one](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) is pretty good.

[This one](https://blog.interlinked.org/tutorials/git.html) is similar, but more humble.


> git workflow

Developers have a workflow like factory workers.

Your work must integrate with parts from others.

Your workflow is how you merge your changes with others'.

You don't need to worry about this. We aren't deploying anything.
