## Hack Oregon Applications

### PlotPDX

What would you do with a ton of [Geographic Data about Portland](http://ec2-52-88-193-136.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/services/)

- Demolition Permits
- Crime Data
- Building Permits

What would you show, visualize?
What would you predict, cluster, compare?
What other data would you need/like?


### Campaign Finance

If you had the financial transaction records for all Oregon:

- campaigns
- PACs
- candidates
- campaign managers

- money spent
- money received
- size of donors
- business location
  - donors
  - recipients
  - vendors
- home addresses
  - donors
  - recipients
  - vendors
- stated puposes/causes
- political party

What would you do with it?

What could you predict?

- election outcomes
- donor relationships
- money flow

What data would you need to train the model?
What would you need to make use of it?
What if transaction data was delayed by 1 month?
What if transactions were "laundered"?

### Agriculture

If you had access to the agricultural harvest data for Oregon:


- crop (Barley, Blackberries, Walnuts)
- county (jurisdiction)
- location
- acreage
- type of soil
- climate/weather
- water usage?

What would you do with it?
What could you predict?

- harvest during a drought?
- harvest during boom/glut (perfect weather)?

### Hunger

What would you do if you had...

- rental costs for each county in Oregon
- food costs in Oregon
- tax code information
- minimum wage in Oregon
- income statistics across Oregon
- meal statistics for poor families in Oregon
- federal guidelines and formulas for food "insecurity"

What would you do with it?
What could you predict?
Could you run a simulated experiment?
Could you estimate the "ROI"?
Is it possible that business would benefit from wage hike?

### Education

What would you do if you had...

- enrollment information for 10000+ individual students
- demographic information for those individuals

How would you protect their privacy?
Could you estimate the impact of policies?
Could you determine cause and effect?

## Motivation

If you have somehow avoided it today, I'm going to inject some ml. Answer a poll for me so i can learn which lectures worked well and which didn't. Get andrew at harv.is to sponsor us?
Bots are already our companions. We are already cyborgs. So get to know your partner or you may lose control over your life to those pulling the puppet strings of the bots. Train them like you'd train your pet dog, or lizard

## Food for Thought, Discussion

- What about wisdom of the crowds?
  - Can't we humans work together to be smart than machines?
- Is machine learning susceptable to any systematic biases?
  - Do logic fallacies apply to machines?
  - Are machines susceptable to cognitive biases?
  - Might any of the logic fallacies apply to machines?
- Do machines ever rely on "Rules of Thumb"?
  - hint: look up the word "heuristic"
- Are machines inherently moral, ethical? amoral? unethical?
  - Are machines objective? Do machines have prejudices, biases? 
- Are machines inherently anti-social? pro-social? a-social? 
  - What about the "control problem" that Elon Musk and others are worried about?
  - What about self driving cars having to decide whether endanger their owner by swerving to avoid
    - a squirrel
    - a family of ducks
    - a cat
    - a dog
    - an abandoned $1M Lamborghini
    - a dead body 
    - a dying person just hit by a car
    - a fatally ill zombie
    - an elderly or disabled person
    - hospital gurny with a patient
    - a pedestrian
    - a child
    - a baby carriage
    - a crowd
  - What if you are in a hury or have important cargo?
    - What if you are pregnant?
    - What if you're whole family is in the car?
    - What if Obama is your passenger?
    - What if you are an assassin or thief or mobster?
    - What if you are driving an armored car full of depositor savings or employee paychecks?

## Homework (optional)

- Sign up for the free Udacity course ["Introduction to Machine Learning"](https://udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud120)
- Skip Lesson 0 (Welcome), and watch 2nd video in [Lesson 1 "Bayes Classifier -- Acerous or Non-Acerous"](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud120/l-2254358555/e-3077538977/m-3061308637)
  - What might be wrong with this picture?
  - Hint, it's not the "picture" that's wrong, but a feature concept.
- Watch the 3rd video in Lesson 1 to Take the [Supervised Classification Quiz](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud120/l-2254358555/e-2345828677/m-2407048539)
- Take the quiz on [Scatter Plot Intuition](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud120/l-2254358555/e-3014058778/m-3022458589)
- And [another](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud120/l-2254358555/e-3015228658/m-3022458586)
- How many human logic fallacies are listed on wikipedia or in any list?
  - cut and paste into excel, libre office, Google sheets, or your text editor
  - estimate
- If you like finance watch "The Big Short"
  - look for applications for machine learning
  - could a machine have predicted the 2008 crash?
