* [codeshare.io/](https://codeshare.io/)
* [live coding in python](http://pythontutor.com/live.html#mode=edit)
* [Haskell, Python, C++, etc](http://codepad.org/)
* [javascript editing with collaboration at jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)

Here's an incomplete list of concepts and vocabulary that a student in a machine learning or data science course should understand.
This could be a source of quiz, exam, or job-interview questions.
