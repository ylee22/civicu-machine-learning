# HOMEWORK

Read over the jupyter notebook from class today and see if you can modify the model or the visualizations in some way.
An awesome way would be to add another column to your X table to create a multivariate linear regression.
A super-awesome way would be to see if you can figure out a way to do a logistic regression with only the sklearn LinearRegression model (and some sigmoid math on the input and output features or a customized cost/loss functioon).
