# Homework

Fix the retrieval-based chatbot in the [class notebook](1 Retrieval Chatbot.ipynb).

The TFIDF-vector retrieval worked fine, but the PCA vector retrieval did not.

1. Improve the PCA vector retrieval chatbot by increasing or reducing n_features.
2. Test it by passing an exact statement from the df.Context column and make sure it can find that row in the table
3. Test it on a string you compose that means the same thing as the Context statement you used in #2, but with different words. Paraphrase the original statement. That's the power of PCA on natural language text (LSA, latent semantic analsyis)
