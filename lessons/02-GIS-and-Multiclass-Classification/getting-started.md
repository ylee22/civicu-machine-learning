# Getting Started

First lets find out if you're in the right class ;)

## What is Machine Learning?

- Artificial Intelligence?
- Modeling (Regression)?
- Prediction?
- Statistics?
- Data Science?

In some ways, machine learning is automated data science.  
But you can't automate all of Data Science.  
Machine's need a lot of help from humans.  
In future sessions we'll learn about [generative models](../NLP-generative-models.md) and genetic algorithms for developing software and writing code.  
But these systems are a long way from taking our jobs as Data Scientists and Machine Assistants.  
It takes human understanding to build a system(otherwise you wouldn't be here).  
And it requires a lot of effort to [get data ready](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/05/data-science-inconvenient-truth.html) for machine learning.

So maybe Machine Learning is:

> What a software developer would do if she were given a data science problem.

A Machine Learning expert is:

> Someone that knows more statistics than a developer and more computer science than a statistician"

## "Official" Definition

[Here's what Stanford Profs think about AI and ML](http://ai.stanford.edu/users/sahami/cs109/MachineLearning.pdf)

## Data Science

"A statistician in Silicon Valley"

- You're going to learn statistics if you are a python developer
- You're going to learn python and data if you already know stats
- You're going to to know a lot about everything when we're done

## What do you want to learn?

- Tell me about your plans, career, ideas

## Data Science

Data Science is just using data to create representations or abstractions of data.  
Often these representations are useful for performing prediction. Predicting the future is what humans spend their lives learning how to do. It's why children perform "experiments" by pushing their food of the table and onto the floor. They are testing their "hypothesis" that a caregiver will put it back on the table or clean up the mess. They are also testing their hypothesis that the food won't just disappear, or transform into something different (like icecream), or become unedible.

Just like a child, machines have to perform experiments  repeatedly with the same starting conditions (inputs) and also with a large variety of inputs, before they'll get "bored" and be certain that they know how to predict the future for new examples.

But one thing that humans learn how to do (in young adulthood) that machines are still very bad at is inferring general concepts from only one or two examples. This is an area of active research. Keep this in mind when you are asked to apply machine learning to a new problem. During this course you will get a feel for where current machine learning technology works well and where it does not, this is "the state of the art." So when you try to push the limits, you'll know when to get creative or when to reuse someone else's approach.

## Machine Intelligence is Everywhere

Machine Learning snuck up on us and is now a part of nearly everything we do. Children spend most of their waking hours looking at a computer screen of some sort. Adults spend a little less time, but still much of their lives. Those screens are windows into a variety of machine learning systems.

Brainstorm with students about ml in their lives
- did they ride public transport, use Google maps, wayze, or Evans ridereport app
- did they use their phone
  - login, wifi, autocomplete
interact with any websites?
  - purchases
  - analytics
  - advertisements
- Spam filter
- Spelling corrector
- Fraud detection
- Recruiting (reading resumes and matching to job openings)
- writing poetry
- generating visual art (painting)
- recognizing cats v dogs
- recognizing individual faces
- video captcha to verify face photos
- password security/randomness estimate ?
- banjo predictions of world events from twitter
  - only have to be a ms faster
  - beating associated press and CNN by hours
- chess
- jeopardy
- deep mind atari video games (breakout expert in 4 hr)
- go (enumerated all boards)
- cpap machines
- prosthetics
- radiology doctor bots
  - mri
  - ekg
- authentication: logging onto your computer, b am account
  - ekg
  - fingerprint
- Starbucks customer RF id
  - preference profiling
- home automation

## Hack Oregon Applications

### Campaign Finance

If you had the financial transaction records for all Oregon:

- campaigns
- PACs
- candidates
- campaign managers

- money spent
- money received
- size of donors
- business location
  - donors
  - recipients
  - vendors
- home addresses
  - donors
  - recipients
  - vendors
- stated puposes/causes
- political party

What would you do with it?

What could you predict?

- election outcomes
- donor relationships
- money flow

What data would you need to train the model?
What would you need to make use of it?
What if transaction data was delayed by 1 month?
What if transactions were "laundered"?

### Agriculture

If you had access to the agricultural harvest data for Oregon:


- crop (Barley, Blackberries, Walnuts)
- county (jurisdiction)
- location
- acreage
- type of soil
- climate/weather
- water usage?

What would you do with it?
What could you predict?

- harvest during a drought?
- harvest during boom/glut (perfect weather)?

### Hunger

What would you do if you had...

- rental costs for each county in Oregon
- food costs in Oregon
- tax code information
- minimum wage in Oregon
- income statistics across Oregon
- meal statistics for poor families in Oregon
- federal guidelines and formulas for food "insecurity"

What would you do with it?
What could you predict?
Could you run a simulated experiment?
Could you estimate the "ROI"?
Is it possible that business would benefit from wage hike?

### Education

What would you do if you had...

- enrollment information for 10000+ individual students
- demographic information for those individuals

How would you protect their privacy?
Could you estimate the impact of policies?
Could you determine cause and effect?

## Motivation

If you have somehow avoided it today, I'm going to inject some ml. Answer a poll for me so i can learn which lectures worked well and which didn't. Get andrew at harv.is to sponsor us?
Bots are already our companions. We are already cyborgs. So get to know your partner or you may lose control over your life to those pulling the puppet strings of the bots. Train them like you'd train your pet dog, or lizard
