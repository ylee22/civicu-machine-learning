## Experimenting

### [DOX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments)

Even though you're at Hack University, we're not going to teach you how to [DOX](huml/hackor/email-intersection.ipynb) your enemies. Though we do have [example](huml/hackor/email-intersection.ipynb) uses for Jeremy Tanner's [Python for Evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-4mvV34dFw&utm_content=buffer4ef80&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) ideas and data. We are going to teach you how to DOX your own world, Design of Experiment style.

One of the things that can make toddlers so challenging to teach is that they are natural, incorrigible, scientists. They experiment with the world every moment  of the day. Everything is new. So they try things to see how the world reacts. That's "Experiment Design" in action. So if you have children or toddler relatives that push a glass of milk off the table, don't scold them. Explain to them how gravity and liquids work and then show them how the mop works too! And if you have a particularly advanced child in your life, you can share this lesson with them about designing your experiments properly.

### Experimenting

Machines are like children, they only get smarter and more useful by making mistakes, proving things wrong. You need bad examples as well as good ones if you want to teach a machine to classify those examples. 

### Learning vs Teaching

- Most people learn by doing.  
  - So do machines.  
- Teachers show their students what things are important  
  - Data Scientists show machines which "features" to learn  
  - Also have to show them how to compute and do anything those features ;)  


### Data Science 

We're going to briefly give you a feel for various concepts taught in the Hack University Data Science course by Heidi Perry.

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Specificity
- Sensitivity
- Recall
- False Positives and False Negatives
  - medical trials
  - Bayes rule for blood test results
- True Positives and True Negatives
- Confusion
- Avoiding 
  - [P-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value)
  - [F-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-test)
- ROC
- Cross Validation (P-Value)
  - Academic papers report 0.05 disproportionately
- Overfitting
  - Regularization
  - Random Dropout

### Statistical Inference

- Bayes Rule
- Naive Bayes model/prediction

### Regression
