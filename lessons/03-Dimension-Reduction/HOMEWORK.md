# Homework

Explore high dimensional space and vector spaces

1. create a DataFrame of 1000 random 2-D vectors (`pd.np.random.randn` or `.randrange`)
2. compute the length of all those vectors (root of the sum of the squares of the dimensions, so you should get 1000 lengths
3. what is the min length and max length for your 2-D vectors
4. compute the 1,000,000 distances between every pair of 2-D vectors
5. what is the min length and max distance between all your vectors

## Bonus

repeat all that for a 3-D vectors, 10-D vectors, and 20-D vectors
