# Civic U Machine Learning

Civic U Machine Learning course material, example python code, civicu python package, and jupyter notebooks.

## DESCRIPTION

In this class you'll

- Learn to see the world from the perspective of a machine
- Recognize machine learning in your daily life in Portland
- Find ways to apply machine learning to Hack Oregon projects
- Appreciate the kinds of algorithms that work for different problems and kinds of data ("model selection")
- Assemble the pieces of a machine learning pipeline using python packages ("feature engineering")
- Assess the "quality" of a machine learning model or pipeline ("cross validation")
- Recognize the "scaling" challenges of machine learning ("scaling")
- How to build a production machine learning pipeline ("online learning")
- Recognize when human intuition leads you astray, and how a machine can do better ("logical fallacies")

## WHO SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE

If you like discovering patterns and trends in data or the way the world works, you enjoy this class. And you'll be excited to know that it's possible to teach machines to recognize and react to those patterns while you sit back and just feed them data. You'll learn how in this class.

## HOW DO I KNOW I’M READY?

Do you know how to write a python function? Can you instantiate and manipulate a python object (like a `dict` or array)? Can you plot a table of data in Spreadsheet or in python? Do you know what "linear regression" is? If so, you're well-prepared to get the most out of this class.
